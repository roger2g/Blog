            DID YOU KNOW THAT THE ENERGY OF THE SUN IS ESSENTIAL FOR LIFE ON
            EARTH? UNDERSTAND THIS STORY BETTER
          </h1>
          <p class="p-text">
            If the Sun did not exist or would cease to exist, the Earth's orbit
            would be modified. The path that our planet takes around the Sun is
            a consequence of the gravity between the two bodies. Without the
            star, this path would be changed. Earth could have gravitational
            interaction with another object, for example.
          </p>
          <p class="p-text">
            It is important to remember that without the Sun, the Earth would
            not have formed. Our Solar System formed about 4.6 billion years ago
            from the same cloud of gas and dust. From most of this material, the
            Sun emerged. What was left gave rise to Earth, the other planets,
            comets and asteroids.
          </p>
          <p class="p-text">
            The energy of the Sun is responsible for keeping the planet warm,
            for the movement of the oceans, for the formation of winds (heating
            the air) and for the water cycle. Without the energy of the Sun, we
            would live without light and the seasons would not exist. Our planet
            would be very cold and atmosphere would be denser. There would be
            little wind and, little by little, the waters would freeze.
          </p>
          <p class="p-text">
            In addition to being essential for the Earth, the Sun is important
            for the beings that live here. Almost all of them depend on the
            light and heat of the Sun to survive. Plants need light to carry out
            photosynthesis , a process in which they transform carbon dioxide
            and water into glucose, proteins and vitamins, releasing oxygen into
            the atmosphere. Without sunlight, plants would not be able to feed
            and would die.
          </p>
          <p class="p-text">
            In addition to ensuring the survival of plants, photosynthesis is
            essential for animals and humans. Without plants, the entire food
            chain would be affected: herbivorous animals would have nothing to
            eat and, little by little, they would also die. Then carnivorous
            animals and humans would also run out of food.
          </p>
          <p class="p-text">
            Heat also favors the action of enzymes (substances that cause
            chemical reactions inside cells) present in plants and animals. Some
            animals, such as fish, amphibians and reptiles, can improve
            metabolic activity when the temperature of the environment is high.
            Thus, the organism gains energy to continue functioning.
          </p>
          <p class="p-text">
            The sun also plays an important role in our health. For strong bones
            and teeth, we need vitamin D, which is not readily available in most
            foods. What is found in them is a substance that turns into the
            vitamin when exposed to the sun's rays. A lack of vitamin D causes
            problems with your teeth and makes your bones weak. Therefore, the
            ideal is to take a few minutes of sun every day â€“ don't forget the
            sunscreen!
