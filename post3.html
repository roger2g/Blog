          <p class="p-text">
            Let's think, just for the sake of argument, that you've spent the
            last few decades living under a rock and that you think the oceans
            are pieces of water without value, interest or relevance. Try now to
            form a mental image of the Earth without them. How did you get out?
            An arid, greyish-white ball, reminiscent of… Mars? Then.
          </p>
          <p class="p-text">
            The oceans cover more than 70% of the Earth's surface and contain
            97% of all the water on the planet. They influence climate and
            weather, stabilize temperature, shape terrestrial chemistry and
            provide a home for the greatest diversity of species on the planet.
            Every molecule of oxygen we breathe, every drop of water we drink,
            every food we eat, connects us to the ocean, whether we live on the
            coast or in the most remote and inhospitable inland part of the
            globe.
          </p>
          <p class="p-text">
            It is thought that the first forms of life developed in the ocean,
            still in the absence of oxygen, and that most of the oxygen in the
            atmosphere originally resulted from the actions of photosynthetic
            organisms in the ocean. In other words, it was the ocean that
            allowed, and it is still the ocean that allows, for the Earth to be
            habitable. As the American oceanographer Sylvia Earle, the world's
            greatest reference in the oceans and marine life, usually
            summarizes, “without blue, there is no green”. Because the key to
            the existence of life is water, and water is 97% oceans.
          </p>
          <h2 class="h-about">"MY FAULT"</h2>
          <p class="p-text">
            It took about 4.5 billion years for the Earth to meet all the
            conditions to host us. But it took us just 4.5 decades to consume,
            deplete and significantly alter their highly delicate systems
            essential to our very survival.
          </p>
          <p class="p-text">
            The second half of the 20th century was dramatic for the “assets” of
            the planet. The ocean, which is the Earth's circulatory system, is
            clogged with hundreds of millions of tons of plastic and other
            waste, which, in conjunction with industrial fishing, removes
            hundreds of millions of wild animals from the scene, damaging the
            food chains that they shape the chemistry of the planet and
            influence the carbon cycle, the nitrogen cycle, the oxygen cycle,
            the water cycle, in other words, our life support system.
          </p>
          <p class="p-text">
            In this period, we lost – or rather, we took and consumed – more
            than 90% of large marine species, such as tuna and swordfish. The
            coral reefs are disappearing. And the health of the ocean suffers,
            with direct consequences for the health of the planet and, of
            course, for humanity.
          </p>
          <h3 class="h-about">ABSORB HEAT AND CO2</h3>
          <p class="p-text">
            The oceans exert fundamental control over climate and weather
            conditions. They transport energy and dominate the water and carbon
            cycles, attenuating temperature fluctuations and maintaining the
            stability of the atmosphere's composition.
          </p>
          <p class="p-text">
            A big part of the oceans role is to absorb energy (heat),
            distributing it more evenly across the Earth. A few meters of the
            ocean's surface store as much heat as the entire Earth's atmosphere.
            So, as the planet warms, it is the ocean that receives most of the
            extra energy. And this has implications for the balance of
            ecosystems: when the ocean gets too hot, the life that inhabits it
            is forced to adapt… or die.
          </p>
          <p class="p-text">
            Fish and other marine animals breathe oxygen and release carbon
            dioxide, just like land animals. And marine plants absorb carbon
            dioxide and release oxygen, just like terrestrial plants
            (incidentally, seaweeds are responsible for producing much of the
            oxygen we breathe). But CO2 absorption is another vital function of
            the oceans, achieved through an ingenious “aspiration, mixing and
            retention” system.
          </p>
          <p class="p-text">
            The ocean absorbs carbon dioxide from the atmosphere whenever air
            meets water. Then the wind causes waves and turbulence, helping the
            CO2 to mix at the surface and penetrate deeper water, giving the
            water an opportunity to absorb carbon dioxide.
          </p>
          <p class="p-text">
            We owe the oceans to absorb about a quarter of the CO2 we emit. And
            as we don't stop emitting, the oceans are paying the price, seeing
            their chemistry changed and their water more acidic.
          </p>
          <p class="p-text">
            It's time to give back and embrace this cause. Because, going back
            to the wise words of oceanographer Sylvia Earle, “nothing else will
            matter if we fail to protect the oceans”.
