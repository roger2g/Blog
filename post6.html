            we?
          </p>
          <p class="p-text">
            Basically, it is a sport and leisure practice that aims to climb
            mountains and rocky elevations, either through hiking or climbing.
            In addition, mountaineering has different degrees of difficulty and
            duration. Another interesting point is that mountaineering covers
            some activities, such as:

            to talk about now! Read on and check out

          <h3 class="h-about">INCREASE YOUR ENVIRONMENTAL AWARENESS</h3>
          <p class="p-text">
            The first and one of the main benefits of mountaineering is the
            increase in your environmental awareness, that is, from the moment
            you start in the sport and have direct contact with nature, your
            posture changes. It happens naturally and you start to develop a new
            look at the environment, adopt attitudes of care, appreciation and
            preservation.
          </p>
          <h3 class="h-about">IMPROVED ABILITY TO CONCENTRATE</h3>
          <p class="p-text">
            The practice of mountaineering requires the development of your
            awareness in the present, attention to your actions and everything
            around you. Therefore, to be successful in sport, it is important to
            have concentration and be committed to yourself (physically and
            emotionally) and to nature. With the constancy in mountaineering,
            the improvement of the ability to concentrate and focus becomes part
            of your daily life. So, another one of the benefits of
            mountaineering for your personal and professional life.

            most hikers' list. From the moment mountaineering becomes part of
            your life, you will meet many people and create great friendships.
            Friends to walk, talk and have fun together.
          </p>
          <h3 class="h-about">IMPROVES MENTAL HEALTH</h3>
          <p class="p-text">
            In an increasingly connected and pressure-filled world, whether at
            work or in personal life, practicing outdoor activities, breathing
            fresh air and connecting with nature has been the choice of many
            people.
          </p>
          <p class="p-text">
            In this sense, the practice of outdoor sports – such as
            mountaineering – brings more lightness and improves mental health.
          </p>
          <p class="p-text">
            It is important to note that mountaineering does not replace
            treatment with a qualified professional when necessary. However, the
            benefits of mountaineering for the physical and mental health of
            practitioners are undeniable.
          </p>

          <h3 class="h-about">INCREASES SELF-ESTEEM</h3>
          <p class="p-text">
            Mountaineering increases self-esteem. This is because the practice
            of physical activity releases endorphins, the happiness hormone. In
            addition, contact with nature, with green, is therapeutic and you
            can connect with your essence. Finally, contact with the sun during
            walks activates vitamin D, improving calcium absorption, reducing
            the risk of diseases and helping with mood.
