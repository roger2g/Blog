          <p class="p-text">
            Replacing meat with certain types of sustainably sourced seafood can
            help people reduce their carbon footprints without compromising
            nutrition, according to an analysis of dozens of marine species that
            are consumed around the world.
          </p>
          <p class="p-text">
            A study, published Sept. 8 in Communications Earth & amp;
            Environment, suggests that farmed bivalves—molluscs such as mussels,
            clams, and oysters—and wild, small, and surface (pelagic) fish,
            which include anchovies, mackerel, and herring, generate fewer
            greenhouse gas emissions and are more nutrient-dense than than beef,
            pork or chicken.
          </p>
          <p class="p-text">
            “The research aimed to do a better job of understanding the climate
            impacts of seafood through the lens of very diverse nutritional
            qualities,” says co-author Peter Tyedmers, an ecological economist
            at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Canada.
          </p>
          <p class="p-text">
            The results echo previous studies, including work by members of
            Tyedmers' group that focused on seafood consumed in Sweden. "This
            time, the researchers wanted to include a more diverse global range
            of seafood," said the economist.
          </p>
          <h2 class="h-about">BENEFITS OF THE “BLUE” DIET</h2>
          <p class="p-text">
            Food production is responsible for about a third of global
            greenhouse gas emissions, mainly methane and carbon dioxide. More
            than half are driven by livestock. Plant-based diets offer a
            lower-impact alternative to meat consumption, but "solutions tend to
            ignore the benefits of seafood-based diets," the study says.
          </p>
          <p class="p-text">
            Using 41 species of seafood, the researchers established a nutrient
            density score that accounted for essentials such as certain fats and
            vitamins. Species surveyed included fish, crustaceans, bivalves and
            cephalopods bred and caught in the wild (such as octopus and squid).
            The team then used available emissions data for 34 of these species
            to compare their nutrient density with emissions associated with
            their production or capture.
          </p>
          <p class="p-text">
            Half of the seafood species offered more nutritional benefits in
            terms of emissions. Pink salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha), sockeye
            salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) and small wild-caught pelagic fish, as
            well as farmed bivalves, were the best choices for nutrient-dense,
            low-emission protein sources. White fish such as cod (Gadus sp.)
            also had a low climate impact, but were among the least
            nutrient-dense foods. Wild-caught crustaceans had the highest
            emissions, with a carbon footprint rivaled only by beef. The authors
            note that their data do not include “post-production” emissions,
            such as those generated by refrigeration or transport.
          </p>
          <p class="p-text">
            The analysis adds more perspective to the role of seafood in food
            systems, says Zach Koehn, a marine scientist at the Stanford Center
            for Ocean Solutions in California. He adds that an obstacle in
            applying this research will be the need to make seafood more
            available and affordable, because those who could benefit from these
            nutrient-dense foods may not have access to them.
          </p>
          <p class="p-text">
            Tyedmers agrees that access to multiple diets is a privilege. “Every
            opportunity there is to replace seafood with beef is a small climate
            victory,” he says. "But it doesn't have to be every meal."
